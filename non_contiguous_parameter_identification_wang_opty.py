Parameter Identification from Noncontiguous Measurements with Bias and Noise
============================================================================

In parameter estimation it is common to collect measurements of a system's
trajectories from distinct experiments. For example, if you are identifying the
parameters of a mass-spring-damper system, you may excite the system with
different initial conditions multiple times and measure the position of the
mass. The data cannot simply be stacked end-to-end in time and the
identification run because the measurement data would be discontinuous between
each measurement trial.

A workaround in opty is to create a set of differential equations with unique
state variables for each measurement trial that all share the same constant
parameters. You can then identify the parameters from all measurement trials
simultaneously by passing the uncoupled differential equations to opty.
This idea is due to Jason Moore.

In addition, for each measurement, one may create a set of differential
equations with unique state variables that again share the same constant
parameters. In addition, one adds noise to these equations. (Intuitively this
noise corresponds to a force acting on the system).
This idea is due to Huawei Wang and A. J. van den Bogert.

So, if one has *number_of_measurements* measurements, and one creates
*number_of_repeats* differential equations for each measurement, one will have
*number_of_measurements* * *number_of_repeats* uncoupled differential equations,
all sharing the same constant parameters.

Mass-spring-damper-friction Example
===================================

The position of a simple system consisting of a mass connected to a fixed point
by a spring and a damper and subject to friction is simulated and recorded as
noisy measurements. The spring constant, the damping coefficient
and the coefficient of friction will be identified.

**State Variables**

- :math:`x_{i, j}`: position of the mass of the i-th measurement trial [m]
- :math:`u_{i, j}`: speed of the mass of the i-th measurement trial [m/s]


**Parameters**

- :math:`m`: mass [kg]
- :math:`c`: linear damping coefficient [Ns/m]
- :math:`k`: linear spring constant [N/m]
- :math:`l_0`: natural length of the spring [m]
- :math:`friction`: friction coefficient [N]
- :math:`n_{i, j}`: noise added [N]
